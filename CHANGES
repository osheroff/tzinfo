Version 0.0.2 (tzdata v2005m) - 13-Sep-2005 
-------------------------------------------

* Country and Timezone data is now loaded into class rather than instance 
  variables. This makes Timezone links more efficient and saves memory if
  creating specific Timezone and Country classes directly.
* TimezonePeriod zone_identifier is now defined as a symbol to save memory
  (was previously a string).
* TimezonePeriod zone_identifiers that were previously '' are now :Unknown.
* Timezones and Countries can now be returned using Timezone.new(identifier)
  and Country.new(identifier). When passed an identifier, the new method
  calls get to return an instance of the specified timezone or country.
* Added new class methods to Timezone to return sets of zones and identifiers.
