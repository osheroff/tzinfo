Version ????? (tzdata v2005n) - ???????????
-------------------------------------------

* period_for_local and local_to_utc now allow resolution of ambiguous
  times (e.g. when switching from daylight savings to standard time). 
  The behaviour of these methods when faced with dealing with an ambiguous
  local time has now changed. If you are using these methods you should check
  the documentation. Thanks to Cliff Matthews for suggesting this change.
* Added require 'date' to timezone.rb (date isn't loaded by default in all
  environments).
* Use rake to build packages and documentation.
* License file is now included in gem distribution.
* Dates in definitions stored as Astronomical Julian Day numbers rather than
  as civil dates (improves performance creating DateTime instances).
* Added options to TZDataParser to allow generation of specific zones and
  countries.
* Moved TimezonePeriod to timezone_period.rb.
* New TimezonePeriodList class to store TimezonePeriods for a timezone and
  perform searches for periods.
* Timezones now defined using blocks. TimezonePeriods are only instantiated
  when they are needed.

Version 0.0.4 (tzdata v2005m) - 18-Sep-2005
-------------------------------------------

* Removed debug output accidentally included in the previous release.
* Fixed a bug in the generation of friendly zone identifiers (was inserting
  apostrophes into UTC, GMT, etc).
* Fixed Country <=> operator (was comparing non-existent attribute)
* Fixed Timezone.period_for_local error when period not found.
* Added testcases for Timezone, TimezoneProxy, TimezonePeriod, Country and
  some selected timezones.

Version 0.0.3 (tzdata v2005m) - 17-Sep-2005
-------------------------------------------

* Reduced visibility of some methods added in Timezone#setup and Country#setup.
* Added name method to Timezone (returns the identifier).
* Added friendly_identifier method to Timezone. Returns a more friendly version
  of the identifier.
* Added to_s method to Timezone. Returns the friendly identifier.
* Added == and <=> operators to Timezone (compares identifiers).
* Timezone now includes Comparable.
* Added to_s method to Country.
* Added == and <=> operators to Country (compares ISO 3166 country codes).
* Country now includes Comparable.
* New TimezoneProxy class that behaves the same as a Timezone but doesn't
  actually load in its definition until it is actually required.
* Modified Timezone and Country methods that return Timezones to return
  TimezoneProxy instances instead. This makes these methods much quicker.
  
  In Ruby on Rails, you can now show a drop-down list of all timezones using the
  Rails time_zone_select helper method:
  
  <%= time_zone_select 'user', 'time_zone', TZInfo::Timezone.all.sort, :model => TZInfo::Timezone %>


Version 0.0.2 (tzdata v2005m) - 13-Sep-2005 
-------------------------------------------

* Country and Timezone data is now loaded into class rather than instance 
  variables. This makes Timezone links more efficient and saves memory if
  creating specific Timezone and Country classes directly.
* TimezonePeriod zone_identifier is now defined as a symbol to save memory
  (was previously a string).
* TimezonePeriod zone_identifiers that were previously '' are now :Unknown.
* Timezones and Countries can now be returned using Timezone.new(identifier)
  and Country.new(identifier). When passed an identifier, the new method
  calls get to return an instance of the specified timezone or country.
* Added new class methods to Timezone to return sets of zones and identifiers.
