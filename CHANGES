Version 0.0.3 (tzdata v2005m) - 17-Sep-2005
-------------------------------------------

* Reduced visibility of some methods added in Timezone#setup and Country#setup.
* Added name method to Timezone (returns the identifier).
* Added friendly_identifier method to Timezone. Returns a more friendly version
  of the identifier.
* Added to_s method to Timezone. Returns the friendly identifier.
* Added == and <=> operators to Timezone (compares identifiers).
* Timezone now includes Comparable.
* Added to_s method to Country.
* Added == and <=> operators to Country (compares ISO 3166 country codes).
* Country now includes Comparable.
* New TimezoneProxy class that behaves the same as a Timezone but doesn't
  actually load in its definition until it is actually required.
* Modified Timezone and Country methods that return Timezones to return
  TimezoneProxy instances instead. This makes these methods much quicker.
  
  In Ruby on Rails, you can now show a drop-down list of all timezones using the
  Rails time_zone_select helper method:
  
  <%= time_zone_select 'user', 'time_zone', TZInfo::Timezone.all.sort, :model => TZInfo::Timezone %>


Version 0.0.2 (tzdata v2005m) - 13-Sep-2005 
-------------------------------------------

* Country and Timezone data is now loaded into class rather than instance 
  variables. This makes Timezone links more efficient and saves memory if
  creating specific Timezone and Country classes directly.
* TimezonePeriod zone_identifier is now defined as a symbol to save memory
  (was previously a string).
* TimezonePeriod zone_identifiers that were previously '' are now :Unknown.
* Timezones and Countries can now be returned using Timezone.new(identifier)
  and Country.new(identifier). When passed an identifier, the new method
  calls get to return an instance of the specified timezone or country.
* Added new class methods to Timezone to return sets of zones and identifiers.
